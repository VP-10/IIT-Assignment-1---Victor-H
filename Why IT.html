								<h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
								<p>IT is something I have been passionate about for a while now. I was initially planning on studying a Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering after high school and was actually offered a spot. However, after a long thought process and many stressed moments, I decided to pass this up and accept a spot in IT. I figured with the vast career’s IT has to offer, it was a field I wanted to explore. With so many opportunities, I aligned my desire to help others and my interest of how we interact with technology on a daily basis and was fixated to work in user interactive experience or interaction design. This field requires such a solution-oriented mindset and is an attribute that any employee would be searching for which is what made me want to continue down this IT path.</p>

								<h4>Why RMIT?</h4>
								<p>RMIT and Monash University have always been the two institutes I was wishing to study at due to having friends who were past students who enjoyed the course and they are also well known in teaching IT. As mentioned, I did first year IT at Monash University and found the course there quite enjoyable. However, the following year I decided to take a break from studying to focus on work and bettering myself but was a short-come journey due to the pandemic. I then made the choice during this lockdown to see what life would be like at RMIT and decided to apply for this institute. It is quite a different environment but so far, is filled with many amazing teachers and friends.</p>

								<h4>Expectations?</h4>
							  <p>My idea before attempting my studies was what field would have the most abundant careers to pick from but also, learn new skills that would further my education. IT ticked both boxes and hence, found myself in this IT course. I also endeavoured to learn how to make a ‘true’ impact in today’s society and figured with IT being the leading advancement in the world, it was sure to be a relevant and impactful field that is needed in almost any type of work. Having the simplest of IT skills is very handy and can go a long way.</p>
