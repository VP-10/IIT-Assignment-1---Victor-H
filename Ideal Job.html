									As an interactive designer (IxD), you are tasked with creating a meaningful connection between both user and product or design they desire to use. This can range from computes/laptops, home appliances, to the everyday mobile phone that people use. It is a committed field to improving the world on every scale. Furthermore, the impact this career has on a daily is what drew me to wanting to pursue this field. It is practically limitless as everyday, in every situation, we as humans learn and develop constantly by taking on feedback from others, past experiences, ideas and more.
									This field truly does require an innovative mindset and one that is not bound to self-centred thinking. Taking on board any feedback is necessary as this fosters that relationship between user and device as they are the ones using it. Inevitably, being solution-oriented and striving to improve when you think all is done is needed in this field. Due to society advancing everyday, an IxD needs to be able to stay on top of it and absorb any ideas, no matter how small or big. Following this, any work environment needs employees who have a great work ethic, always persistent and determined, take feedback on board to self-improve, adaptable and strong communication skills.
									Consequently, these skills must be accompanied with the appropriate qualifications to ensure successful completion with the tasks presented. These may include but not limited to:
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-15 col-12-medium">
												<ul>
													<li>User Experience (UX) or Interactive Design experience – Having prior experience in these fields, whether it be on the job or studying a course relating to it, will certainly give you an advantage as you will be well versed in the knowledge and some practical skills required when undertaking these careers. </li></br>
													<li>User psychology and critical analysis - Being able to understand your user or ‘customer’ is crucial as means stronger communication and thus, leads to a more optimal, efficient, and effective approach when facing tasks. Likewise, critical analysis in the situations and projects you encounter is key to discerning all the possible approaches you can take, the potential adversities, ways to overcome them, and hence, the best possible strategy to guarantee a job well done.</li></br>
													<li>Project Management (E.g. Time Management) – One of the most underlying and highly required qualifications when it comes to anything related to huge, complex tasks. It is imperative that one can manage and allocate time and resources to different areas of a project to allow it to be completed within the given restraints.</li></br>
													<li>Design and Innovative Portfolios – For UX and IxD, your professional portfolio is your most significant qualification as it shows off your prowess and creativity that you can bring to a team and project. Your portfolio is not only a collection of your accolades but a representation of you and how innovative you can be.</li>
												</ul>

									Currently, my job as a karate consultant (sales) and volunteering as a karate instructor has helped honed my communication skills, being solution-oriented, reinventing myself and adapting how I teach. These are all necessary in my field and translate across to all careers. However, I have no experience in IxD or UX experience, but I am looking to pursue this as a major in my course or later down the track, take a separate course to help further my skills and experience. Evidently, I will be more competent in the field and have more knowledge to offer from completing this course. The key to ensuring I have the best opportunity to get into this career is by experience. No matter the firm or workplace I am offered, experience is experience and it is invaluable as it exposes the employee to different situation, environments, and opportunities that you then can improve upon and learn from. Furthermore, I plan to make the most of the opportunities and put myself out there. This may be leadership in projects, design and technical competitions, internships and more. My skills, qualifications and experience will certainly grow but this will assist in the creation of a professional portfolio that will help with my career.
